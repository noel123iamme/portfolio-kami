title: My Bootcamp Experience
---
I just finished my first coding bootcamp.  I took the Full-Stack Web Developer track at [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io).

This was a great beginning course to building complete web applications with HTML, CSS, Ruby, and the Ruby on Rails framework.
Besides the basics of HTML, CSS, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails, I learned:

* About the Model, View, and Controller (MVC)) of a web application
* About the Controller's HTTP actions: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)) 
* About the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle of development
* About the Test Driven Development (TDD) principle

Coding is fine, but the main thing you learn in this coding bootcamp (and I would imagine in others) are the concepts of development, analytical thinking and problem solving.  The course is laid out as a series of projects (complete web applications).  As a student, you need to learn the **"how-to"** in finding the answers to the problems presented by using resources at your disposal.  From the Bloc's own FAQ and forum, to mentor/student interactons, to external coding forums/repositories, and Google.com search.  You obviously can't memorize the complete Ruby Code and API library, that's what the documentation is for.  But, since every application has an MVC, there are standard practices that you learn to follow.

As a MS VB/SQL developer, I relied heavily on SQL to manage table relationships.  Much of the application code related to data retrieval was pushed to the SQL server to handle.  We needed to write compex SQL stored procedures and functions to join, query, calculate data to be passed back to the application.  The VB application would handle the the view or reporting of that data.  But, Microsoft is a closed environment in that sense.  The database code was no longer portable, but rather database specific.  I had to learn to do without writing my own SQL in Ruby.  Instead, the Model definitions would determine how Ruby would generate the corresponding SQL.  This made the application portable amoung different databases (such as using SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production).

Will this get me a job?  Maybe.

You can now write a few apps.  You've updated your resume.  You've updated your web profile: Linked In, Github, Twitter, maybe even Facebook.  You've create a personal website to showcase your portfolio or production apps.  You've written a few blogs about yourself, what you've learned, your 1, 5, 10 year plan, future development work.  You've gotten some tips on job seeking and interviewing.  On paper, this all seems like you're moments away from landing that dream job.

The only flaw I see, is that everyone in your bootcamp worked on the same projects.  They created the same web presence that you just did.  There is nothing really to differentiate each student from one another when putting together our portfolio of projects.  About the only thing we have is our capstone project.  This project is supposed to be anyting that we want and our personally defining project.  The only problem is is that most beginning students won't have enough knowledge or time to complete such a capstone.  

What these bootcamps do do is provide a student with enough knowledge to begin working on their own projects after the bootcamp is completed.  It will be in the time, post apprenticeship, where the graduates take the time to build a portfolio of new apps that will get you a job.  The apps you built during the apprenticeship simply aren't enough.  Your "true" portfolio will be the apps you build post bootcamp.  It will be those projects that will showcase your **"true"** ability as a developer.

As a new graduate myself, I already know that I still have a lot of work ahead of me.  I need to continue my education and expand my knowledge.  I need build and complete my capstone - not just one capsone, but 3, 5, maybe even 10 or more.  As many as it takes for a future employer to feel confident in my ability and offer me a job.
