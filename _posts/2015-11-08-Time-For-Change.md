title: Time For a Change.
---
I've been working as a Microsoft VB/VB.NET/SQL programmer for a small software company in SF for the past 20 years.  The company had been good to me, and I hadn't really thought about ever needing to change carreers.  Then something happened.  The economy had some significant ups and downs that caused many of my company's clients to either merge or disappear.  Since much of our revenue comes from licensing, maintenance, and enhancements, that meant a sharp decrease in revenue and, of course, the need to reduce staffing.  What I once thought was the company that would take me to retirement, is slowly downsizing to a core set of personnel.  Sadly, I'm seeing my future in flux.

I decided, now might be a good time to start looking for a new job.  As I scoured the internet for job posting that I might be qualified, I quickly came to discover that technology and the direction that companies are moving have changed.  I mean, I have enough HTML/CSS, VB, and SQL to get by in my job, but to the outside world, that simply wasn't enough.  I needed to **"up my game"**, so to speak, and start learning "what's new" and fast.

While I still have a job and income, my first thought was to simply go back to school.  Should I get a degree in CS at a local university?  That would take too long, I thought.  The curriclum wouldn't be focused enough.  I'd have to go through years of general education while trying to learn what I need to make it in the real world.  I mean, do I really need to take English 101 again, to become a programmer?

Then, I took a couple certificate classes on making my "Project Manager" title more official.  Again, I found out pretty quickly, that there was a lot more to project management then what was entailed in my current job.  In order, to get that PMP Certification, I had to show experience I didn't seem to have.  Now, I'm feeling rather depressed about my situation.

I have knowledge in many areas of software development and project management, but not enough to be an expert at either.

I'm comfortable with the idea that I won't become an expert overnight.  What I *can* do is increase my knowledge in the areas that I have the most amount of experience.  I started my college carreer as a Computer Science student.  I've been a software programmer for, at least, the last 20 years.  Why not just keep learning application development?  That's when I discovered Coding Bootcamps.

Coding Bootcamps provide that focused education that I was looking for.  I needed it to be online, self-paced so that I can continue working while go to school.  Most importantly, the education being provided at an excelerated pace to get me started and finished quickly.  I started with Ruby / Ruby on Rails.  Next up, iOS mobile application development.  And, the future..., I'll know when I get there.
