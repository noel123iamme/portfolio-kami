### Summary

Build a production quality SaaS app that allows users to create their own wikis.

### Explanation

Blocipedia represented my first project where most of the things I learned in my foundation project were being implemented in this project.  This posed my most challenging project yet.  While I had already worked on many of the concepts for this project before, I was on my own to implement them.  In the foundation project, much of the work was walked-though with me.  Now, I had to implement them trying to make small references to the foundation course.
