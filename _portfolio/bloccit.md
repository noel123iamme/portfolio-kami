### Summary

Bloccit is a Reddit replica for social networking and news posted and managed by registered users.

### Explanation

As my first Rails app, this project looks to touch on several key features of a web application.  It contains a landing page (Home), several tabs for Topics, Posts, Comments, User information.  We needed to build in features for user access (login/logout), user roles (admin, moderator, member, and guest).  Email authentication and notification.  As the developer, I needed to build from ground-up a production class web applicaiton.

### Problem

The primary user stories were:
<ul>
  <li>Create a Home, About page</li>
  <li>Style my website so as to be more user friendly</li>
  <li>Create a Topics page where underneath you can have.</li>
  <li><ul>
    <li>Posts</li>
    <li>Comments</li>
    <li>Favorites</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Create the ability to sign-in Users where users can</li>
  <li><ul>
    <li>Can create Topics, Posts, and Comments.</li>
    <li>Can create private Posts</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

### Solution

* Bootstrap CSS
